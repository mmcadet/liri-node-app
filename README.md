LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface.
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will display my latest tweets. 




### Instructions

1. Navigate to the root of your project and run `npm init -y` &mdash; this will initialize a `package.json` file for your project. The `package.json` file is required for installing third party npm packages and saving their version numbers. If you fail to initialize a `package.json` file, it will be troublesome, and at times almost impossible for anyone else to run your code after cloning your project.





### BONUS

* In addition to logging the data to your terminal/bash window, output the data to a .txt file called `log.txt`.

* Make sure you append each command you run to the `log.txt` file. 

* Do not overwrite your file each time you run a command.

### Reminder: Submission on BCS
