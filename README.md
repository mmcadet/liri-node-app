LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface.
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will display my latest tweets, spotify songs, and movies.

### BONUS

* In addition to logging the data to your terminal/bash window, output the data to a .txt file called `log.txt`.

* Make sure you append each command you run to the `log.txt` file. 

* Do not overwrite your file each time you run a command.
