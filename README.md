LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface.
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will display my latest tweets, spotify songs, and movies.
